Numbers of vaccine doses distributed under the base case and counterfactual models are given in Table 1 and Figure 1. Focusing on our chosen period of up to 1 July 2021, we find 10% increase in the US in the doses administered and corresponding 20% increase for the UK, under the most optimistic scenario of vaccines being available 90 days earlier. However, the differences are much larger in the earlier periods. For example, up to 1 April 2021, the corresponding increases are 115% and 70%, respectively.

In our main period of interest, up to 1 July 2021, our results suggest that for the UK accelerating availability of vaccines would have averted between 9,000 (assuming 30-day acceleration; lower 95% bound is 6,000) and 45,000 (90-day acceleration; upper 95% bound is 60,000) deaths. This translates to 1.4-6.7 deaths averted per 10,000 or XX% reduction in total burden of deaths in the period between start of vaccinations and 1 July 2021.

In the US, corresponding numbers of deaths averted are 51,000 (lower 95% bound of 42,000) and 131,000 (upper 95% bound of 180,000) for 30-day and 90-day acceleration respectively. This gives a range of 1.6-4.0 deaths averted per 10,000  or XX% reduction in total burden of deaths in the period between start of vaccinations and 1 July 2021.

As these numbers suggest, the simulations for the UK are typically more sensitive to how much earlier the vaccines become available, likely due to larger number of doses administered per person (also including a higher uptake of boosters: about 50% in the UK compared to only about 25% in the US up to 1 January 2022) and no binding constraints on vaccine availability in the UK even under the most optimistic scenario, unlike in the US. We also noted that while the simulations in the US are affected by the acceleration facter a bit less, within each counterfactual they are more uncertain. 

**Cut-off dates for calculation of deaths averted.** If we extend the modelled period up to 1 January 2022, the average number of deaths averted generally increases (12-61k for the UK, 31-137k for the US; the ranges represent 30-day to 90-day accelerations). However, uncertainty increases too, particularly for the US, where due to the “rebound” effect the number of deaths can even increase under some trajectories when compared to status quo[^12].

**Using excess deaths.** If using the excess deaths the effects show similar trends, but are generally smaller, sometimes by as much as a third. This diminished effect is somewhat to be expected, since excess deaths measure also includes non-COVID-attributable deaths and may therefore be less sensitive to increasing vaccination.

**Varying duration of natural immunity [work in progress—Witold].** In both countries, the estimates of deaths averted showed little sensitivity to the estimated duration of natural immunity (Supplementary Table 11. The estimates of deaths averted in the UK was also relatively insensitive to the estimated vaccine efficacy, though the estimate in the US was more sensitive to this value (it is worth noting that in the case of the US the model explored captured a wider range of variation in vaccine efficacy) - see Supplementary Table 9. Note that for long-run estimates of deaths averted in the US (up to Jan 2022), higher estimates of vaccine efficacy were associated with much greater uncertainty over the number of deaths averted. This may be due to the fact that, given a more effective vaccine, waning immunity will have a larger impact on the end results.
The estimate of long-run deaths averted in the US was extremely sensitive to the estimated duration of
vaccine derived immunity, with a difference of 14 days in this parameter estimate yielding long-run estimates of deaths averted that ranged from 32 255 to negative 11 456 (that is, 11 456 extra deaths) for a 30 day advance in the vaccination schedule. Notably, short estimates of vaccine duration were also associated with extreme decreases in the uncertainty over the number of deaths averted. Note that the short run estimates of deaths averted (up to July 2021) were robustly positive, but were also substantially more uncertain for longer estimates of the duration of vaccine protection

[^12]: In our main period of interest, up to 1 July 2021, our results suggest that for the UK accelerating availability of vaccines would have averted between 6,000 (assuming 30-day acceleration; lower 95% bound is 5,000) and 30,000 (90-day acceleration; upper 95% bound is 31,000) deaths. This translates to 0.9-4.5 deaths averted per 10,000. In the US, corresponding numbers of deaths averted are 39,000 (lower 95% bound of 13,000) and 120,000 (upper 95% bound of 161,000) for 30-day and 90-day acceleration respectively. This gives a range of 1.2-3.6 deaths averted per 10,000.
