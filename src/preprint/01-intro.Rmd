# Introduction

The development and testing of vaccines for COVID-19 progressed at an unprecedented pace, with vaccinations approved in some countries within less than a year from the start of the pandemic. However, even with accelerated approvals the COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on global health and economies. In the United States and United Kingdom alone, hundreds of thousands of lives were lost in the period it took to approve and complete mass vaccinations.

It has been suggested that the vaccines could have been made available even earlier. One proposal to accelerate their availability involved use of human challenge trials (HCTs) to test for efficacy. In HCTs a small group of volunteers are intentionally infected with a disease in order to study the efficacy of potential treatments or vaccines. While both ethical and technological barriers to adoption of HCTs are considerable, they have the potential to significantly accelerate the efficacy studies, at least in theory.

The potential benefits of accelerating vaccinations, both in terms of health outcomes and economic impacts, are likely to be significant. In fact, research has suggested that these benefits may be orders of magnitude larger than the costs associated with acceleration (Castillo et al. 2021). Despite this, there has been relatively little research on the impact of speed on vaccination efforts, particularly in terms of epidemiological modelling.

A recent review paper (Więcek, 2022) found only one quantitative estimate of the impact of accelerating testing of vaccines on mortality. This estimate, from Berry et al. (2020), was based on prospective simulation done early in the pandemic, which understandably overestimated timelines for vaccine field trials and was not able to use information about time-course of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 to calibrate the model. 

In this paper, we aim to provide a simple revision to this approach, by using retrospective data to quantify the potential health benefits of accelerating the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. While we use HCTs to motivate our approach, the model we use is generic and applicable to all measures that could have led to earlier use of vaccines. More concretely, we proceed in two stages. First, we calibrate an epidemiological model informed by retrospective analysis of data on observed vaccinations and mortality. Considering the actual vaccine development timelines and comparing them to counterfactual acceleration scenarios, we then use these models to simulate counterfactual models and their associated mortality. 

We calculate the health benefits, which we measure in terms of deaths averted, for two countries, the United States and the United Kingdom[^1]. They are large developed countries that were at the front of the queue for vaccine deliveries and therefore would have been among those most likely to benefit from accelerated testing. However, there are also considerable differences in timing of waves, circulating variants, speed of vaccination, adoption of boosters, and vaccine prioritisation, to name a few. Therefore it’s instructive to compare the two cases. As we will discuss throughout this article, we contrast these two countries to provide an illustrative example, because they differed in the nature of epidemics (timing of waves, different strains), non-pharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination policy and uptake.

Our epidemiological modelling approach simplifies many relevant real-world factors, including individual behaviours and responses to public health interventions. Therefore, we also conduct some sensitivity analyses and discuss some potential unknowns associated with accelerating vaccine approvals, such as (1) less precise information on efficacy or safety, (2) impact on public confidence in vaccines, (3) the potential for production and distribution constraints to nullify the benefits of accelerated testing.

[^1]:  The model we use could also estimate reductions in infections. Similarly, we could estimate reductions in hospitalisations or severe cases. However, for simplicity we focus only on mortality, since the relative reductions in all outcomes can be thought of as roughly comparable, and averting deaths is typically main variable that is of interest to public health decision makers.
