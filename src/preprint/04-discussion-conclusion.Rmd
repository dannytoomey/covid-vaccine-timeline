## Subsequent infection waves

While our main results present the number of deaths averted up to July 2021, we simulated the counterfactual scenarious up until the end of 2021. The longer timeline includes an additional wave of infections in both the US and the UK. Our model shows much more uncertainty over the effect of earlier vaccination timelines for this second wave of infections in the United States. In this country, for vaccines 90 days earlier, the 95% interval of simulation traces ranges from 36 739 to 221 093 extra lives saved by January 2022, and the intervals for 30 and 60 days earlier include some traces in which the earlier timelines resulted in a larger number of deaths in total. The UK, on the other hand, shows less variation in the impact of earlier timelines on the number of deaths in the second wave, and all counterfactuals result in fewer deaths at all points in time.

There are numerous ways that altering the timing of vaccinations can alter the pandemic trajectory for subsequent waves of infection. Effects that enter into our model are:
 1. Earlier vaccine administration means that people will experience waning vaccine protection earlier, which could make them vulnerable if this waning coincides with a peak in infections (this is expected to increase infections at later dates)
 2. Earlier vaccine administration can reduce the total number of infections immediately following the vaccination campaign, leading to fewer people having naturally acquired immunity at later dates (this is expected to increase infections at later dates)
 3. Earlier vaccine administration can reduce the number of people infected at the start of a followup wave of infections (this is expected to increase the time taken to reach an infection peak and reduce the overall number of infections)
 4. Earlier vaccine administration goes together with earlier administration of booster doses, so people may be *more* protected at followup waves due to having recently received a booster (this is expected to reduce the overall number of infections)

Earlier vaccine administration may also lead to behaviour change, which is not captured by our model. The effect of behaviour change downstream of vaccination is also hard to predict. If earlier vaccination leads to fewer infections in deaths at a given point in time, and as a result people relax social distancing behaviour, then our model might overestimate short-term infections and deaths in the early vaccination scenario (though people would of course be benefiting from reduced social distancing). At the same time, such a situation would lead to a higher rate of natural immunity, which could reduce the impact of a subsequent infection wave.

We hypothesise that differences between the US and the UK that lead to the divergent results may be:
 - Booster doses were much more popular in the UK than in the US. On Jan 1 2022 50.5% of the UK population had received booster doses compared to 23.4% of the US population [@mathieuCoronavirusPandemicCOVID192020]
 - Our model predicts that in the short run, earlier vaccinations suppress the level of infections in the UK more than they do in the US. 

To test the hypothesis that differential booster doses explain some of the difference, we ran a simulation where the rate of booster doses in the US was counterfactually adjusted so that the coverage of booster doses in both the US and UK were equal on Jan 1 2022 (to achieve this, we rougly doubled the booster dose coverage in the US). The results are in Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:deaths-averted-table-doubleboost). We note that this counterfactual doesn't drastically reduce the uncertainty over long run deaths averted in the US, suggesting that the differences between the US and the UK estimates are driven by something other than differences in booster adoption.

While we show that earlier vaccinations have large benefits to mortality in infections waves occurring close to the vaccination campaign, and our best guess is that earlier vaccinations yield large benefits to mortality overall, we are substantially less certain of the latter conclusion. Due to uncertainty about the effects of early vaccination on followup waves, we are substantially uncertain about the overall size and sign of the mortality benefit for COVID-19. Furthermore, future pandemics (or even followup waves of COVID-19) are going to differ from the period we studied, and the overall benefits of accelerated vaccinations are likely to be sensitive to these differences.

## Sensitivity to modelling assumptions

We explored various alternative model configurations in order to assess the sensitivity of our conclusion to modelling assumptions. Compared to a hypothetical ideal model that yields correct counterfactual assessments, the model we employ is likely to differ in a number of ways:
 - It may differ structurally. We might anticipate some structural differences - for example, overdispersion in the distribution of contact rates is not captured by our model, but overdispersion in this distribution was typically found to be high [@endoEstimatingOverdispersionCOVID192020]. However, there may be other structural differences that we do not anticipate
 - The assumed distributions of input parameters may differ in our model and in the hypothetical ideal

Both of these differences mean that the fitted values of $R_t$ are also likely to differ between our model and the hypothetical ideal, and hence they may yield substantially different assessments of counterfactual scenarios. If it turns out that counterfactual assessments are very sensitive to input parameter values, then we might conclude that our estimates are likely to differ substantially from the "true" counterfactual. Because of the prospect of structural differences, this is true even if we have done a very good job of estimating parameters. If our results are robust to variation of parameters within a reasonable range, then if we believe that our model is capable of yielding a good approximation to the ideal for some "reaonsable" parameter choices, we should also think our counterfactual assessments are a good approximation to ideal counterfactual assessments.

We assess the impact of three different parameter estimates on our overall results. To do this, we examine the average conclusion from the model runs featuring the top and bottom deciles of each of the following parameters:
 - The average infection-blocking efficacy of one and two doses of the vaccine
 - The average duration for protection due to one and two doses of the vaccine
 - The average duration of protection due to natural immunity

In both countries, the estimates of deaths averted showed little sensitivity to the estimated duration of natural immunity (Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:deaths-averted-table-durR). The estimates of deaths averted in the UK was *also* relatively insensitive to the estimated vaccine efficacy, though the estimate in the US was more sensitive to this value (it is worth noting that in the case of the US the model explored captured a wider range of variation in vaccine efficacy) - see Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:deaths-averted-table-vei). Note that for long-run estimates of deaths averted in the US (up to Jan 2022), higher estimates of vaccine efficacy were associated with much greater uncertainty over the number of deaths averted. This may be due to the fact that, given a more effective vaccine, waning immunity will have a larger impact on the end results.

The estimate of long-run deaths averted in the US was extremely sensitive to the estimated duration of vaccine derived immunity (DVI). Under a 30 day advanced vaccination schedule, an estimated mean DVI of 153 days yielded long-run estimates of 1 178 deaths averted, while an estimate of 150 days -- just 3 days less -- yielded a median of 14 513 deaths averted. Notably, short estimates of vaccine duration were also associated with extreme decreases in the uncertainty over the number of deaths averted. Note that the short run estimates of deaths averted (up to July 2021) were robustly positive, but were also substantially more uncertain for longer estimates of the duration of vaccine protection.

Our model is already very uncertain about the effect of earlier vaccinations on the second infection wave in the US. However, the high sensitivity of this figure to the estimated duration of vaccine-derived protection offers an extra reason to be unsure that the model is providing us with an accurate assessment of the counterfactual impacts on this timescale.

We also run an identical analysis to our main analysis, except with a model fit to reported numbers of COVID-19 deaths instead of COVID-19 deaths estimated from excess mortality. The results are reported in Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:reported-deaths-averted-table) and Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:reported-deaths-averted-plot). This method yields larger estimates of deaths averted than our main method, particularly up to July 2021 where the estimates are close to the 95th percentile estimate for the main method. This is in spite of the fact that the total estimated number of deaths under this method is somewhat lower than under the excess mortality method.
